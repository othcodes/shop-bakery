Setup and run application:

I installed (concurrently) in mode dev in order the run both server and client simultaneously.

## Setup for server side

cd /project-name
npm install

## Setup for client side

cd project-name/client
npm install

Then go back to the root folder and you can simply run the following command "npm run dev" :)
